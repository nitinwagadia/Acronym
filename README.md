This application “Acronyms App Builder” is very user-friendly.

words with different meanings. On creating a category short forms and
fulforms of words could be added by the user in that category. On long
press,on a category the option of delete appears, so that the user can
delete it easily if not required. Secondly, on long press, on an acronym,
options such as add, delete and update are provided to the user. Full
forms could be updated or unwanted acronyms could also be deleted. The
app is specially made for all the students. And finally, on pressing back
button you will get a dialog confirming whether you really want to exit.
